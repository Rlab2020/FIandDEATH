## ASSOCIATIONS OF FRAILTY INDEX EXPOSURE WITH INDIVIDUAL PROTEINS AND PROTEOMIC SIGNATURES

model1 <- glm(protein~fic0+age+sex+imd+income+edu+bmi+ethnic+whr0+nosmoking+drinkingM+regular+dieth+sleeph+fastt+sampleage+season, family='gaussian', data0)
model2 <- glm(signature~fic0+age+sex+imd+income+edu+bmi+ethnic+whr0+nosmoking+drinkingM+regular+dieth+sleeph+fastt+sampleage+season, family='gaussian', data0)

# The associations of frailty index with each individual protein and its corresponding proteomic signature were obtained by running the above code.



## ASSOCIATIONS OF INDIVIDUAL PROTEINS WITH DEATH

# The associations of each individual protein with death were obtained by running the above code.

## MEDIATION ANALYSIS

mediation <- mediate(modelMediate, modelDirect, treat = fic0, mediator = protein)

# The mediation effect of each individual protein in the association of frailty index with each death were obtained by running the above code.
